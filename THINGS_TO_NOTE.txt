1. Simulation for some reason doesn't generate towns on first day. 
2. Progression of commands:
    - Goods accumulated from previous day population
    - Goods are transported after railways have progressed
    - Input commands are then processed
        - If a new town is founded, their initial stockpile is generated on the day they are created 

3. Railways can begin transportation on the day their construction is completed. So if a single railway was completed on day 5, 100 goods can be transported that same day.
