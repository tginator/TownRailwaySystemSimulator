Town Railway System Development Simulator
=================

This project simulates a network of towns exchanging goods via dynamically constructed railways. It was developed for the Object-Oriented Software Engineering unit at Curtin University and demonstrates the use of core OOP principles, design patterns, and system modeling. 

## Features
- Dynamically created railway networks between towns
- Real-time state updates and status changes
- File-based input/output for town and goods configuration
- UML State and Class diagrams included
- Use of key design patterns: **Observer**, **State**, **Factory**, **Dependency Injection**
- Multithreading for concurrent good transfers

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8)
- Gradle build system
- PMD for linting
- JUnit for testing
- GraphViz for diagram visualization
- Command-line execution for simulation control

## How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed. From the project root directory:

```bash
./gradlew run
